# Seezee-Surprise
A Friday Night Funkin' mod using Codename Engine. This mod is for Seezee's Birthday. So there isn't exactly any lore or anything serious.

This mod is also short as I don't plan to add much songs (Especially since it also has a short timeframe, so as of april, I don't have that much time on my hands) However, depending on where things go, this could be extended...? I doubt it though lol
